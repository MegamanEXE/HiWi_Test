Serious VR Games Test

Unity + Blender student job application test. Had a few hours to work on this so please don't judge me based on this. Time issues aside, I had a lot of fun (finally) learning Blender seriously.

I'm aware of the standard Unity workflow of organizing assets into respective folders, but I just had to get this working as soon as possble.

Intended for Mr.Alexander Sch√§fer at DFKI.
